# Motivation



Probably dentistis or the Dentistry (the science) in general will be on of the latest professions affected or touched by the technology revolution (MAchine learning algorithms, Artificial inteligency or even robots taking care of our patients). This staement seems to be true if we take the dental practice in general but it is not true if we narrow our arguments for readiology, for example. It sees that this is going to be one of the first specialization in dentistry where the professional (the dentisty, the doctor) will be replaced by a machine. => Use of openCV and AI/ML.
