<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Dental Informatics Project

I am a dentist, specialized in Social Medicine - <a href="http://www.isc.ufba.br/en/">ISC/UFBA-Brazil 2004</a>, Geoprocessing AND GIS (Geographic Information Systems) - <a href="http://igd.unb.br/">IG/UNB-Brazil 2005</a>, Software development - <a href="https://www.teccart.qc.ca/index.php">TECCART-Canada 2010</a> and Bio-Informtaics - <a href="http://info.uqam.ca/">dIN/UQAM-Canada 2013</a>. It is needless to say that I made health informatics my first choice on my professional path. Health informatics has change a lot around the World, since 2003, when I start to work on it at <a href="https://en.unesco.org/">UNESCO</a> using CGI Perl scripts and  HTML to render real time maps - connected to a COHORT database of nuclear accident patients in order to create spacial analysis and better offer the care they needed. The <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/">Google Earth</a> project was in its embryo steps, cellphones where limited (compared with todays smatphones) and the only way to retrieve lat-long data to insert in a health geo-database was through a Garmin GPSs and many others softwares. During the past 7 years the Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and BioInformatics have intensively unlocked the doors that separate the World of Health Sciences and the Informatics. Today, in 2021, when the World is still facing consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and when the humankind economic processes has been hardly affected, health professionals around the planet are giving or putting more attention to informatics and possibilities that can be opened by its usage - from labs to collective healthcare providers, passing across, of course, ours clinical offices and clinical practices. The BioTech companies are testing and developing new approaches and solutions to improve the healthcare providers processes. More than ever there are a lot of opportunities for health professionals to interact with these BioTech companies in order to guide them to create better solutions that can fit as best as possible the professional and patients needs.

It is a new World that require from health professionals, a new way to do older actions and create new processes as well trough the use of new technics and technologies. The train is still running and soon - maybe 5-10 years from now, we will be talking about the "new technologies of the future" - the biosensors integrated with IoT devices and HighSpeed Internet (5G, 6G, 10G, ...). We will be soon integrated to the Economy 4.0 for health and the big question is - Are universities across the World already preparing health professionals for this new way of work process? Are health professionals be an active actor in this change or are they going to be a passive actor. Just to keep this time in perspective, 10 years is only 2 generations of General Dentists or General Physicians. Students that starts now in 2021 and will finish in 2026 and students that will start in 2026 and will finish 2031. Are we (Health professionals) fully prepared to be active actors in these changes?

This is the main goal of this project. I want to centralize subjects related to Dental Informatics, share and Invite peers or anyone that can bring ideas and efforts to help the Dentistry to find a smooth path to integrate the Informatics subjects in the dental science. Informatics is a huge world of subjects and it is easy to be lost. We must to concentrate the time and efforts in order to achieve this goal.

# Motivation
>Probably dentistis or the Dentistry (the science) in general will be on of the latest professions affected or touched by the technology revolution (MAchine learning algorithms, Artificial inteligency or even robots taking care of our patients). This staement seems to be true if we take the dental practice in general but it is not true if we narrow our arguments for readiology, for example. It sees that this is going to be one of the first specialization in dentistry where the professional (the dentisty, the doctor) will be replaced by a machine. => Use of openCV and AI/ML.

JOB OUTLOOK

Dental informatics specialists look for ways to use computers and new technologies to enhance the practice of dentistry. Dental informatics specialists create theoretical models that help dental researchers test new ideas, systems and approaches.

A model for oral cancer, for example, would include information about symptoms of the disease and biological processes that affect cancer growth. Tools built on this model can help dentists diagnose patients quickly and accurately. Researchers can use the model to test theories about how to treat disease.

Dental informaticists also:

Design and implement computer applications that provide dental researchers, educators and dentists with easier access to patient information. One ongoing challenge in dental informatics is building a computer-based charting system for dentists that can effectively incorporate a patient’s entire dental record. Approximately 75% of dental practices use an electronic dental record to manage clinical information and 15% are paperless.
Implement systems to ensure that they operate correctly and are easy for dentists and their staff to use. Many early systems built by dental informatics professionals are still not in regular use, because they are too expensive to install or too complex to operate.
Evaluate systems to determine if they are actually helping to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs or improve practice efficiency.
The field of dental informatics is only about 20 years old, but it has great potential to improve dental research, education and patient care. Dental informaticians study a range of important issues, including:

Creating an electronic oral health record
Developing devices that enable dentists to record patient information while examining the patient
Enabling teledentistry
Compiling geographic information for dental epidemiology studies
Developing standardized vocabularies for dental diagnosis and treatment
Supporting genetic studies in oral health
Developing software for dental education
Creating virtual reality simulators that let dental students practice clinical skills
Developing automated systems to simplify dental office management


Working Conditions | Academic Requirements | Resources
Working Conditions
Experts in dental informatics typically work in a university, dental school, government agency or research organization associated with a large corporation.

Dental informaticians work on long-term research projects that require patience and attention to detail.

They usually work as part of a team that may include researchers from other disciplines, as well as technicians and students. They must keep informed about developments in related areas of computer science, information science, cognitive science, telecommunications, linguistics, engineering and other areas, so they can find ways to apply new developments to dental research and practice.

Salary Range and Outlook
Salaries for dental informaticians will vary according to where they work and the type of work they do. In addition, degrees influence salaries—whether an informatician has a master’s degree or doctorate and whether he or she has a professional degree in dentistry as well.

Academic Requirements
Dental informatics is a subdomain within biomedical informatics that requires extensive education in one or more academic areas. Some dental informaticians train as dentists and receive their informatics training in postdoctoral programs or enroll in advanced degree programs after they have gotten their dental education.

Many colleges and universities offer informatics degrees and have programs and training opportunities in dentistry and other health care disciplines through which students can focus their training.

The American Medical Informatics Association maintains a comprehensive list of academic and training programs in informatics.
