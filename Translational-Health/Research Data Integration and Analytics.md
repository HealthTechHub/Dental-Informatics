#Research Data Integration and Analytics
The Research Data Integration and Analytics (RDIA) group is a team of experienced database developers, data managers and statisticians that provide integrated research study and experimental data management. The team has built the Bio-Laboratory Informatics System (BLIS) data integration and management system using the open source LabKey Server. The team developed BLIS to provide a full-range of data integration services for biomedical and translational research projects including integration of clinical, specimen inventory, experimental assay data.

##Key RDIA services include:

Develop and implement the data management system (BLIS) for collection, storage and data integration of clinical, specimen inventory and laboratory data and files
Develop study data management monitoring plans which includes the implementation of study-specific reports to monitor, enrollment, data completeness and quality, laboratory data workflows and timelines
Consult with investigators to review and implement data collection forms
Perform data monitoring in accordance with the approved Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, if appropriate
Provide analytical tools for data visualization and exploration using BLIS
Consult with investigators to provide informatics support for high-throughput transcription, metabolomics and flow cytometry data analytics. May include:
High-throughput data processing including data normalization
High-throughput data integration (including integration with other external bioinformatics databases)
Bioinformatics data annotation and analytics
Utilization of high-performance HPC resources in collaboration with CIRC staff
Create plan for provision/release of de-identified study data to NIH-designated public data repositories
Work with Universityâ€™s Office of Research and Program Administration and University IT to meet FISMA requirements for grant-specific needs using the BLIS data management system
Participate as protocol team members and attend protocol-specific and/or lab meetings
Provide reporting per grant and project requirements
