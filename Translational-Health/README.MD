# What is Translational Science?
It takes too long to glean health benefits from scientific discoveries. Translational science aims to understand and refine the process of turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve health of individuals and communities.

Scientific translation happens along a spectrum: from bench to bedside and on to populations. But this spectrum is not linear or unidirectional; each stage builds upon and informs the others.

    T0 - Basic Science: Preclinical and animal studies that happen at "the bench" to define molecular mechanisms and drug targets.
    T1 – Translation to Humans: Clinical trials that assess the safety of a drug, device or intervention.
    T2 – Translation to Patients: Clinical trials that test the efficacy of a drug, device or intervention.
    T3 – Translation to Clinical Practice: Clinical trials and outcomes research that test long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of a drug, device or intervention that is already on the market.
    T4 – Translation to Populations: Public health research that tests a drug, device or intervention's benefit to society

>The UR CTSI helps research teams work faster and better. The UR CTSI provides funding, education, resources and services to help research teams collaborate and produce results faster. Through our many programs, we strive to advance science and medicine and improve the health of communities and populations.

>Translation is the process of turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public — from diagnostics and therapeutics to medical procedures and behavioral changes. Translational science is the field of investigation focused on understanding the scientific and operational principles underlying each step of the translational process.
